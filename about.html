			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi, I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Aerospace engineering, University of Michigan. My research interests are computational fluid dynamics and formal verification. I am currently working on formally verifying numerical methods using Coq Proof assistant. I am also working on verification at the source code level using Frama-C and subsequently verify the verification conditions generated using both SMT solvers and interactive proof assistants.
				Prior to joining the University of Michigan, I got my bachelors in Aerospace engineering from Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Kanpur, India. During my undergrad, I mostly focused on Computational Fluid Dynamics and my undergraduate project was about studying the flow inside a lid driven cavity. 
				I am also interested in debating(mostly on politics) and i am enthusiastic about music. Record collection is one of my recent hobbies. I like Kayaking/canoing and hiking.
