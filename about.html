			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi, I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Aerospace engineering, University of Michigan. My research interests are computational fluid dynamics and formal verification. I am currently working on formally verifying numerical methods using Coq Proof assistant. I am also working on verification at the source code level using Frama-C and subsequently verify the verification conditions generated using both SMT solvers and interactive proof assistants.</p>
